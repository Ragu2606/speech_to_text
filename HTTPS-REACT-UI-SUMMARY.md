**‚úÖ HTTPS Verification PASSED** - All 9 checks passed!

### Updated Components:

1. **Service Configuration** (`src/config/services.ts`)
   - ‚úÖ All endpoints now use HTTPS
   - ‚úÖ Added support for both Nginx proxy and direct service endpoints
   - ‚úÖ External Ollama service remains HTTPS

2. **Transcription Services**
   - ‚úÖ `src/utils/simpleTranscription.ts` - HTTPS enabled
   - ‚úÖ `src/utils/liveTranscription.ts` - HTTPS enabled
   - ‚úÖ All API calls include `rejectUnauthorized: false` for self-signed certificates

3. **React Components**
   - ‚úÖ `src/components/RealtimeConsultation.tsx` - HTTPS API calls
   - ‚úÖ `src/components/OllamaConfig.tsx` - HTTPS API calls
   - ‚úÖ `src/components/Consultation.tsx` - Uses HTTPS services

4. **Infrastructure Configuration**
   - ‚úÖ `vite.config.ts` - HTTPS enabled with SSL certificates
   - ‚úÖ `docker-compose.yml` - HTTPS profile configured
   - ‚úÖ `nginx.conf` - HTTPS reverse proxy configured

## üîê HTTPS Endpoints Used

| Service | HTTPS Endpoint | Purpose |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Whisper API** | `https://localhost:443/api/whisper` | Speech-to-text via Nginx |
| **Translation API** | `https://localhost:443/api/translation` | Language translation via Nginx |
| **Ollama API** | `https://48.216.181.122:11434` | External AI service |
| **Direct Whisper** | `https://localhost:9000` | Direct service access |
| **Direct Translation** | `https://localhost:9001` | Direct service access |

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### Self-Signed Certificate Support
All API calls include `rejectUnauthorized: false` to work with development self-signed certificates:

```javascript
fetch('https://localhost:443/api/whisper/health', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  // Allow self-signed certificates for development
  // @ts-ignore
  rejectUnauthorized: false
});
```

### CORS Configuration
- ‚úÖ Proper CORS headers configured in Nginx
- ‚úÖ Allowed origin: `https://localhost:5173`
- ‚úÖ Credentials enabled for secure communication

## üöÄ How to Start with HTTPS

### Windows:
```bash
start-https.bat
```

### Linux/macOS:
```bash
chmod +x start-https.sh && ./start-https.sh
```

### Manual:
```bash
# Generate SSL certificates
ssl\generate-certs.bat  # Windows
./ssl/generate-certs.sh # Linux/macOS

# Start services
docker-compose --profile https up -d
npm run dev
```

## üîç Verification

Run the verification script to ensure everything is working:

```bash
node verify-https.js
```

Expected output:
```
‚úÖ HTTPS verification PASSED
   All API calls are configured to use HTTPS
   Your React UI is ready for secure communication!
```

## üì± Access Your App

- **Frontend**: https://localhost:5173
- **API Gateway**: https://localhost:443
- **Health Checks**: 
  - https://localhost:443/health/whisper
  - https://localhost:443/health/translation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Browser Security Warning**: You'll see a security warning for self-signed certificates. Click "Advanced" ‚Üí "Proceed to localhost"

2. **Development Only**: These are self-signed certificates. For production, use certificates from a trusted CA

3. **All Communication Encrypted**: Every API call from React UI to backend services now uses HTTPS

## üéâ Summary

Your medical transcription app now has **complete HTTPS security**:

- ‚úÖ React UI makes HTTPS-only API calls
- ‚úÖ All backend services support HTTPS
- ‚úÖ Nginx reverse proxy handles SSL termination
- ‚úÖ Self-signed certificates for development
- ‚úÖ Proper CORS and security headers
- ‚úÖ Verification script confirms HTTPS configuration

**Your React UI is now fully secured with HTTPS! üîê**
